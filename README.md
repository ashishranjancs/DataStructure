Graph:

  Graph Traversal: 

    DFS (Depth for Search)
    BFS (Breadth First Search)
    
  Topological Sort
  
  Shortest Path Algorithms

  Shortest Path Problems:

    1. Single Source 
	    I want to find the shortest path from a given node to all other nodes
	
    2. Point to point
	    I want to find the shortest path from A to B
	    Typically done by stopping the single source problem early 
	
    3. All shortest Paths
	    I want to find the shortest path connecting each pair of points in the graph
	
    Unweighted vs Weighted graph:
    
      Unweighted Graph
	      1. Unweighted path cost is the number of edges in the path
	      2. The path contains the name of the vertex through which we get the shortest distance
	
      Weighted graph:

	      1. Weighted path cost is the sum of the costs of the edges in the path.
